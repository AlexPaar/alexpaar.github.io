  abstract = {Recently, the paradigm of software engineering has shifted significantly
	to service orientation based on Web services. Web Services Description
	Language interface specifications provide sufficient information
	to physically access a service. However, these interface descriptions
	are semantically bleak. This work introduces a number of tools, which
	were developed to augment strict syntactic service descriptions with
	semantic information in order to elucidate the meaning of processed
	data and provided functionality. Semantic Web technologies such as
	DAML+OIL were supplemented with natural language support for usability
	improvements both at design- and at runtime.},
