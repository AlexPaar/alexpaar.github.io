  abstract = {Schema and ontology languages have proved to be useful for conceptualizing
	knowledge in a variety of applications. In many software projects,
	XML Schema Definition data types and ontological concept descriptions
	coexist with programming language class hierarchies. However, only
	programming language type definitions are fully integrated into today's
	software development environments. Support for external type systems
	is spotty. For programmers, it is particularly tedious to search
	type definitions in XML schema files and OWL ontologies, to browse
	external type hierarchies, to investigate external type members,
	and to analyze and comprehend the use of external type definitions
	in program code. In this work, it will be argued that improved search
	capabilities are required to ease the use of schema and ontology
	languages in software projects. Difficulties of searching type definitions
	in software project workspaces will be indicated. An extensible compiler
	framework will be outlined that facilitates the use of schema and
	ontology languages in C\# programs. An Eclipse-based integrated development
	environment will be described that makes XML data types and OWL concept
	descriptions first-class citizens of the source code editor. Finally,
	identical search and (just in time) program analysis features for
	programming language and external type definitions will be suggested.},
