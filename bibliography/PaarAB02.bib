  abstract = {This paper presents a novel predication scheme that was applied to
	a SIMD system-on-chip. This approach was devised by improving and
	combining the unrestricted predication model and the guarded execution
	model. It is shown that significant execution autonomy is added to
	the SIMD processing elements and that the code size is reduced considerably.
	Finally, the implemented predication scheme is compared with predication
	schemes of general purpose processors, and it is shown that it enables
	more efficient if-conversion compilations than previous architectures.},
