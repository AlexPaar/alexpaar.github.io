  abstract = {Recently, XML Schema Definition (XSD) has become ever more important
	when it comes to define programming language independent content
	models and type systems. However, writing software that operates
	on XML instance documents still suffers from a lack of compile time
	support for XSD. Especially, obeying facet based constraints imposed
	on XSD simple data types is still error prone and laborious. This
	paper introduces the concept of XSD aware compilation. Zhi\# provides
	static and dynamic type checking for XML simple data types, which
	can be used along with off-the-shelf implementations of the W3C XML
	DOM.},
