  abstract = {In this paper we introduce the BTRC protocol. The Bluetooth Remote
	Control protocol introduces ubiquitous computing to our every-day
	life. We catch up here the ideas of the Network Working Group and
	their Request for Comments to provide a uniform access to any generic
	object in the web by means of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
	In the near future of the ubiquitous computing revolution any device
	occurring in our every-day life will be supplied with the ability
	to be online – that means connected to the Internet. In that way
	the Internet will be considered to include objects accessed using
	an extendable number of protocols.
	
	
	The BTRC protocol is an ISO/OSI layer 7 (application layer) protocol
	running on any lower level protocol that is capable to convey device
	specific command sets to certain appliances.
	
	
	To demonstrate the might of BTRC we have realized this protocol in
	a PDA simulator application, which acts as a universal remote control.
	This system extends the web concept of uniform access to resources
	by applying the same access method, Uniform Resource Identifiers,
	to environment-specific resources, for example for access to the
	TV.
	
	Since these URIs may be embedded within common HTML pages, it is possible
	to access a real-life device just like a web object. This is of major
	consequence because the devices itself deliver XML based BTRC GUIs
	onto the universal remote control display.
	
	
	Further this paper describes how to access legacy (e.g. RC5 infrared
	controlled) devices.
	
	
	In summary, the BTRC protocol and its implementations institute a
	new epoch of ubiquitous computing by simplifying and standardizing
	the way human beings access appliance resources in their real-life
	environment as well as the way these devices collaborate with each
	other. The BTRC approach is really pervasive because the BTRC protocol
	is scalable down to pieces of equipment with even very restricted
	computing and networking capabilities.}
