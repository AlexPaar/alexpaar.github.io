  abstract = {Use-Case Responsibility-Driven Analysis and Design (URDAD) is a service-oriented
	software analysis and design methodology. It is used by requirements
	engineers to develop technology-neutral, semi-formal platform-independent
	models (PIM) within the OMG's MDA. In the past, URDAD models were
	denoted in UML. However, that was tedious and error-prone. The resulting
	models were often of rather poor quality. In this paper we introduce
	and discuss a new Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for URDAD. Its meta
	model is consistent and satisfiable. We show that URDAD DSL specifications
	are simpler and allow for more complete service contract specifications
	than their corresponding UML expressions. They also enable traceability
	and test case generation.},
