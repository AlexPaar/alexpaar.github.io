  abstract = {Recently, several standards have emerged for ontology markup languages
	that can be used to formalize all kinds of knowledge. However, there
	are no widely accepted standards yet that define APIs to manage ontological
	data. Processing ontological information still suffers from the heterogeneity
	imposed by the plethora of available ontology management systems.
	Moreover, ubiquitous computing environments usually comprise software
	components written in a variety of different programming languages,
	which makes it particularly difficult to establish a common ontology
	management API with programming language agnostic semantics. We implemented
	an ontological Knowledge Base Server, which can expose the functionality
	of arbitrary off-the-shelf ontology management systems via a formally
	specified and well defined API. A case study was carried out in order
	to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to use a formally
	specified ontology management API to implement a registry for ubiquitous
	computing systems.},
