  abstract = {Using Web services today has two major drawbacks: firstly, a programmer
	has to guess the appropriate service operations by interpreting syntactic
	operation names provided by WSDL descriptions, and secondly, the
	decision which services to use is fixed at design time. Using ontological
	descriptions, we automate the lookup of services. The lookup occurs
	at runtime, supporting location aware selection and the choice of
	more relevant or alternate services. We use Semantic Web techniques
	such as DAML-OIL to avoid the exact match between services invocations
	and make both service lookup and invocation independent of the strict
	syntactic Web services description.},
