  abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for improving the operation autonomy
	of the processing elements (PE) of SIMD-like machines. By combining
	guarded instructions and pseudo branches it is possible to achieve
	higher operation autonomy and higher instruction level parallelism
	than in previous SIMD/ASIMD architectures. The paper shows that it
	is feasible to avoid most branches and it is also possible to emulate
	conditional execution on the processing elements, either by using
	guarded instructions or by using pseudo branches, thus avoiding unnecessary
	intervention by the array control unit in data-dependant computations.
	Pseudo branches are used when it is not possible to use guarded instructions.
	Additionally, they alsosupport the implementation of complex nested
	if-then-else constructs, improving the execution of irregular data-parallel
	applications. The paper also shows that the simplicity of the method
	allows it to be implemented both in fine-grain and coarse-grain SIMD/ASIMD
	architectures because it does not require significant additional
	silicon area. Finally, it is shown that pseudo branches can be used
	to control the power saving of those processing elements that have
	instructions nullified.},
