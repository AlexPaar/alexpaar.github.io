  abstract = {Ubiquitous computing applications are supported by sophisticated middleware
	components enabling dynamic discovery, invocation and management
	of resources, as well as reasoning in cases of uncertainty. This
	paper advocates semantic Web technologies as primary vehicles to
	achieve dynamic management of resources in ubiquitous computing infrastructures
	and services. We introduce a framework for implementing ubiquitous
	computing services comprising a large number of sensors and perceptive
	interfaces, emphasizing the role of knowledge bases for dynamic registration
	and invocation of resources. We present the use of ontology-based
	mechanisms for controlling sensors and actuators. Moreover, we describe
	the implementation of a knowledge base server that can leverage different
	ontology management systems, while also exposing a host to different
	client access interfaces. The introduced framework has been exploited
	in implementing real prototype ubiquitous computing services, which
	we also outline in the paper.},
