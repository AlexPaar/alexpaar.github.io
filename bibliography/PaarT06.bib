  abstract = {Recently, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and XML Schema Definition
	(XSD) have become ever more important when it comes to conceptualize
	knowledge and to define programming language independent type systems.
	However, writing software that operates on ontological data and on
	XML instance documents still suffers from a lack of compile time
	support for OWL and XSD. Especially, obeying lexical- and value space
	constraints that may be imposed on XSD simple data types and preserving
	the consistency of assertional ontological knowledge is still error
	prone and laborious. Validating XML instance documents and checking
	the consistency of ontological knowledge bases according to given
	XML Schema Definitions and ontological terminologies, respectively,
	requires significant amounts of code. This paper presents novel compile
	time- and code generation features, which were implemented as an
	extension of the C\# programming language. Zhi\# provides compile
	time and runtime support for constrained XML Schema Definition simple
	data types and it guarantees terminological validity for modifications
	of assertional ontological data.},
