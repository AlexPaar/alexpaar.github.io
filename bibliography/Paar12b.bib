  abstract = {Since their standardizations by the W3C, the Extensible Markup Language
	(XML) and XML Schema Definition (XSD) have been widely adopted as
	a format to describe data and to define programming language agnostic
	data types and content models. Several other W3C standards such as
	the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language
	(OWL) are based on XML and XSD. At the same time, statically typed
	object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C\# are most
	widely used for software development. This talk will delineate the
	conceptual bases of XML Schema Definition and the Web Ontology Language
	and how they differ from Java or C\#. It will be shown how XSD facilitates
	the definition of data types based on value space constraints and
	how OWL ontologies are amenable to automatic reasoning. The superior
	modeling features of XSD and OWL will be elucidated based on exemplary
	comparisons with frame logic-based models. A significant shortcoming
	will become obvious: the deficient integration of XSD and OWL with
	the type systems of object-oriented programming languages. Eventually,
	the Zhi\# approach will be presented that integrates XSD and OWL
	into the C\# programming language. In Zhi\#, value space-based data
	types and ontological concept descriptions are first-class citizens;
	compile time and runtime support is readily available for XSD and
	OWL. Thus, the execution of Zhi\# programs is directly controlled
	by the artificial intelligence inherent in ontological models: Zhi\#
	programs don't just execute, they reason.},
