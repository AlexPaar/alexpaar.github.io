  abstract = {The usefulness of the Web Ontology Language to describe domains of
	discourse and to facilitate automatic reasoning services has been
	widely acknowledged. However, the programmability of ontological
	knowledge bases is severely impaired by the different conceptual
	bases of statically typed object-oriented programming languages such
	as Java and C\# and ontology languages such as the Web Ontology Language
	(OWL). In this work, a novel programming language is presented that
	integrates OWL and XSD data types with C\#. The Zhi\# programming
	language is the first solution of its kind to make XSD data types
	and OWL class descriptions first-class citizens of a widely-used
	programming language. The Zhi\# programming language eases the development
	of Semantic Web applications and facilitates the use and reuse of
	knowledge in form of ontologies. The presented approach was successfully
	validated to reduce the number of possible runtime errors compared
	to the use of XML and OWL APIs.},
