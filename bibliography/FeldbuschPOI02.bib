  abstract = {Emerging radio technologies like WLAN and Bluetooth enable electronic
	devices of any kind to communicate with one another. A simple and
	easy to implement application layer protocol called BTRC protocol
	was developed allowing devices to exchange data of any kind and format
	over different protocols like TCP/IP or Bluetooth. Based upon this
	protocol a universal remote control system was implemented. Software
	applications simulating cellular phones and personal digital assistants
	(PDA) were developed as remote control devices. BTRC server devices
	send their graphical XML based user interface to the remote control.
	This way the use of devices is simplified significantly.},
