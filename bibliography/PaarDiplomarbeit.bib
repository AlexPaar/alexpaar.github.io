  abstract = {This work introduces a novel predication scheme that was applied to
	the UC Irvine MorphoSys reconfigurable SIMD system-on-chip. This
	approach was devised by improving and combining the unrestricted
	predication model and the guarded execution model. It is shown that
	significant execution autonomy is added to the MorphoSys SIMD processing
	elements and that the code size is reduced considerably. The implemented
	predication scheme is compared with predication schemes of general
	purpose processors, and it is shown that it enables more efficient
	if-conversion compilations than previous architectures. These new
	capabilities to deal efficiently with parallel if-then-else clauses
	are evaluated by an implementation of a 3D graphics engine. The predication
	enhanced MorphoSys SIMD architecture is specified and simulated using
	a new component based simulator approach that incorporates mathematical
	rigorous abstract state machines to specify the behavior of both
	SIMD instruction sequences and the resulting predicated SIMD array
	and its processing elements. Finally, the specified system is implemented
	in VHDL to show its technological feasibility.}
