  abstract = {In order to extensively explore design space one has to specify a
	system on a very abstract level. Transforming a specification into
	a correct implementation is usually an error prone task. Moreover,
	one may want to specify a system on different abstraction levels.
	This work introduces a component oriented simulator approach that
	comprises AsmL based executable specifications. Test cases are automatically
	generated from the specification. Concurrent verification techniques
	are used to run the specification in parallel with the implementation.
	Feasibility of such rapid specifying techniques is proved by simulating
	a 3D graphics engine for the UC Irvine MorphoSys SIMD system-on-chip.},
