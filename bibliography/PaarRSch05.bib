  abstract = {Recently, ontology engineering has become ever more important when
	it comes to conceptualize knowledge. However, writing software applications
	that operate on ontological knowledge still suffers from a lack of
	connectivity provided by available ontology management systems. Interfaces
	of ontology management systems are either based on error prone programming
	language agnostic remoting protocols or they are restricted to one
	particular programming language. We implemented an ontological Knowledge
	Base Server, which can expose the functionality of arbitrary off-the-shelf
	ontology management systems via arbitrary remoting protocols. Based
	on XML Schema Definition, we defined a full-fledged API for processing
	OWL ontologies. Client access code can be generated automatically
	for virtually any object oriented programming language. Using Description
	Logics terminology, the Knowledge Base Server API was formally specified,
	such that it could be used to validate implementations based on three
	different adapted ontology management systems.},
