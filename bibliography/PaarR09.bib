  abstract = {A major challenge in putting the CHIL vision into practice was to
	integrate contributions from project partners all over Europe and
	the United States. While standard Web technologies such as HTTP support
	core data exchange, perceptual component integration places higher
	demands on distributed intercommunication. Interfaces have to be
	defined for the type-safe exchange of structured data between components
	that are implemented in diverse computer languages.},
