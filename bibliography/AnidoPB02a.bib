  abstract = {A novel method for improving the operation autonomy of the processing
	elements (PE) of SIMD-like machines is presented and discussed in
	this paper. The paper shows that it is feasible to avoid most branches
	and it is also possible to emulate nested if-then-else sentences
	on the processing elements by combining guarded instructions and
	pseudo branches. This prevents unnecessary intervention by the array
	control unit in many data-dependant computations, particularly those
	with short branch sections. The paper also shows that the simplicity
	of the method allows it to be implemented both in fine-grain and
	coarse-grain SIMD/ASIMD architectures because it does not require
	significant additional silicon area. Finally, it is shown that pseudo
	branches can be used to control the power saving of those processing
	elements that have instructions nullified.},
