  abstract = {XML Schema Definition (XSD) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) have
	been widely used to define programming language independent data
	types and to conceptualize knowledge. However, writing software that
	operates on XML instance documents and on ontological knowledge bases
	still suffers from a lack of compile time support for XSD and OWL.
	In this paper, a novel compiler framework is presented that facilitates
	the cooperative usage of external type systems with C\#. For the
	resulting programming language Zhi\#, XSD and OWL compiler plug-ins
	were implemented in order to provide static type checking for constrained
	atomic value types and ontologies. XSD constraining facets and ontological
	inference rules could be integrated with host language features such
	as method overwriting. Zhi\# programs are compiled to conventional
	C\# and are interoperable with .NET assemblies.},
