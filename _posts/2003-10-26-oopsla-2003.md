Selected to be a [Student Volunteer](http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2003/files/stu.html) at OOPSLA 2003 on the Silver Plan.

"The Student Volunteer program is an opportunity for students from around the world to associate with the top people in object-oriented technology, research, and software development. In return for a few hours of their time, student volunteers receive complimentary registration, free admission to tutorials (space permitting), and other benefits. A limited number of volunteers may receive some financial support in return for additional volunteer hours. In past years, job assignments included assisting with symposia and panels, checking badges at doors, operating the information booth, helping with traffic flow and general assistance to keep the conference running smoothly. Our student volunteers are vital to the smooth operation and continued success of OOPSLA each year. We strongly encourage students to become involved in future OOPSLA Student Volunteer programs." *Michael Richmond, IBM Almaden Research Center*
