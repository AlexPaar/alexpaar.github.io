In his talk, Alexander will present real life machine learning use cases and the paradigmatic shift behind their solutions: The classical stack of Software 1.0 is substituted by machine learning and manual feature engineering is obviated with deep learning. Also, Alexander will give a live demonstration of an artificial neural network that is developed in an interactive notebook and deployed as a Web service in a serverless cloud computing environment.
