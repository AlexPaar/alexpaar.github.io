Use-Case Responsibility Driven Analysis and Design (URDAD) is a services-oriented analysis and design methodology for domain experts to develop semi-formal requirements and technology-neutral design models. I contributed to the consistency and completeness properties of the URDAD MDE metamodel.

The URDAD MDE research project was co-funded by the South African National Research Foundation (NRF) in the THRIP program.
