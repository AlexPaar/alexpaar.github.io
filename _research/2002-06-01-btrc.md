The Universal Bluetooth Remote Control System (BTRC) was a contribution to the [2001 IEEE Computer Society International Design Competition](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csidc/). The BTRC system enables devices to communicate over various transport protocols, allowing them to be controlled remotely using either a GUI, plain text messages, hyperlinks or speech. Exiting BTRC use cases include: With a BTRC-powered universal remote control you can use completely wireless technology to voice-operate your VCR in your living room at home while you are in your office at work. Via speech recognition you can set up the universal remote control to build a list of devices that are near your current location and/or are of general interest to you.

BTRC pursues a simple vision to make interaction with electronic devices less obtrusive and our everyday life more convenient:

> "Any device, from anywhere - at any time!"

The Universal Bluetooth Remote Control System (BTRC) was developed by Gerhard Bocksch, Georg Dummer, Ivan Ivanov, Manuel Odendahl, and Alexander Paar representing [Universität Karlsruhe (TH)](http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/) to the [2001 IEEE Computer Society International Design Competition](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csidc/). This page is devoted to remembering this exhilarating project, which was rewarded with the second place team award.

*Note that the following genuine text reflects our insights, opinions, and forecasts from way back then (i.e. 2000/2001).*

The way computing power is used and the way these computing capabilities influence our work and every day life has changed steadily since the invention of the transistor. The mainframe era of the seventies was superseded by the PC era of the eighties with individual computing power on every desktop. The Internet revolution of the nineties has concentrated mainly on these personal computers. This progress is likely to continue in the next few years with an emphasis on PC-based software. Software applications running on personal computers will program the Internet rather than using it as a mere medium to transfer Web pages or MP3s. Protocols and languages such as HTTP and TCP/IP enable programmers to build distributed Web-based applications. Nevertheless, these recent developments will only have an impact on PCs...

Based on [Bluetooth](http://www.bluetooth.com/) wireless technology we enlarge upon the idea of Web-based PC software to a uniform, pervasive access to the functionality of all ubiquitous devices that are connected to the Internet and/or are offering Bluetooth capabilities. The BTRC system enables devices to communicate over various transport protocols, allowing them to be controlled remotely using either an XML-based GUI, plain text messages, hyperlinks or speech.

Exiting BTRC use cases include: With a BTRC-powered universal remote control you can use completely wireless technology to voice-operate your VCR in your living room at home while you are in your office at work. Via speech recognition you can set up the universal remote control to build a list of devices, which are near your current location and/or are of general interest to you.

The BTRC approach is particularly pervasive because the BTRC protocol scales down to pieces of equipment with even very restricted computing and networking capabilities. To prove the applicability of the BTRC approach, various types of server applications were developed. Several Bluetooth-based MS Windows multimedia applications were implemented to demonstrate the collaboration of BTRC and Bluetooth. A BTRC-to-RC5-Infrared-to-Speech relay application that consists of both software and hardware components was designed and implemented to integrate legacy devices into a BTRC system. All implementations were tested to prove their compliance with the BTRC protocol specification.

BTRC boasts a pioneering convergence of up-to-date but so far stand-alone technologies.

## Demo content

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.

Why not put them to use on your new portfolio?
